Hello, Iâ€™m Gustav Bengtsson currently studying informatics at Lund University in Sweden.
I will be graduating at June 2022 and during my time at the university we have used Github as source control for out collab projects.
I've mainly developed with Java and C# and also some webdevelopment with javascript, css and HTML.
Currently i'm working on a chess game in c# when i've have some spare time to further improve my skills in the object orienting paradigm.
I'm started up a minor webproject to get some more experience with javascript.
